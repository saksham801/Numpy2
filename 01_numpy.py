# Numpy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in python 
# It is a python library that provides a multidimensional array object , various derived objects and an assortment of routnes for fast operation on arrays , including mathematical , logical , shape manipulation , sorting , selecting , I/O , discrete Fourier transform , basic liner algebra , basic statisitcal operations , random simulation and much more

# At the core of the numpy package is the numpy objects this encapsulates n-dimensional arrays of homogeneous data tyeps 


# Numpy Arrays vs Python Sequences 

# Numpy arrays have a fixed size at creation unlike phon list Changing the size of an ndarray will create new array and delete the original
# The elements in a Numpy array are all required to be of the same data type and thus will be same size in memory 
# Numpy arrays facillitate advanced mathematical and other types of operations on large numbers of data . Typically such operations are executed more efficiently and with less code than is possible using pythons built in sequeuces 
# A growing plethora of scientific and mathematical pyhton based packages are using numpy arrays though typically support pyhton sequence input they convert such input to numpy arrays prior to processing and tehy oftern ouput numpy arrays .
